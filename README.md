> SAM for Samuel Alvian Mahardika

I'm 24 Year old and have one  brother. Live in Bandung and currently work for myself with my family making snacks and foods for catering, cake store, and traditional cake markets for now.

I was Chemical Engineering Student college at Parahyangan Chatolic University (2017 - 2021). But I was not Finished my Study when Corona happened. 

**NOW..** I'm Here to make a new study, new job, and new journey in Software engineering. With zero knowledge but I have a purpose to move foward. So Let's have fun Together and **_よろしく お願いします_**.
