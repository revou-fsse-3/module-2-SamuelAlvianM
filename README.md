It was a brand new Swallow's edible nest Cleaning Company. Boss wanted me to built system of food hygene and HACCP (_Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points_). I was helped by the QA Association Consultant and learned more about HACCP and ISO 22000 (although I learn it to when I was in university). The company called "Mutu Agung" as the jury and judge for successing the Quality Assurance system for Boss's Ataya Nata Walet (name of the Company).
